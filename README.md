# Mahabharath-ChatBot

This is a basic chat-bot trained on the basis of Mahabharath.

It's not trained on any advanced dataset. instead trained on some basic queries.

As it doesn't have any big dataset it always asks the user whether the output produced is correct or not and if the user says the output is incorrect then the user can input a correct answer which will be used to generate the output the next time when same or similar query is asked.

if you want to modify the dataset according to your own dataset then you can edit the intents.json file
